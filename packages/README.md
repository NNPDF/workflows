# External

This repo provides installer for the following software. 

- [APFEL](https://github.com/scarrazza/apfel)
- [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org)
- [QCDNUM](https://www.nikhef.nl/~h24/qcdnum/)
- [FONLLdis](https://github.com/NNPDF/external)
- [xspace-bench](https://github.com/NNPDF/external)
- [pegasus](https://www.nikhef.nl/~avogt/pegasus.html)

Installers share most of their structure, but since differences are unavoidable
(and they are short and should not change frequently), it is far more flexible
to have a separate independent copy of install script for each external.

## Structure

Each software is packaged providing installers in the subfolders of this repo
(each one name after the program, but all lower case).

The structure of each folder is the following:

- `README.md` (optional): brief description and notes
- `install.sh`: the actual installer, meant to be run by shell (`sh install.sh`)
- `clean.sh`: a cleaner to remove files generated by the installer
- `*.patch`: one or more patches (tiny corrections, or extensions, to the
  original source)

#### Clean

If you clone this as a `git` repository and you run `install.sh` from within its
own folder you should be able to clean also by running:

```sh
git clean -fd
```

If instead you download the script, or you run the script out of the repo, then
running `sh clean.sh` in the same folder should clean up.

## Disclaimer

We are not the original authors of any of these software, all the rights are owned
by them, and maintenance is up to them as well.
